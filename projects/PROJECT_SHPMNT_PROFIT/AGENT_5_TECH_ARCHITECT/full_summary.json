  "notes": "Deep rework of Architecture and TZ for 1C:UT 10.2 ordinary forms. Key changes: (1) Section 0 rewritten with detailed platform description including pseudocode for form element creation, modal dialogs, timer, blocking via register. (2) Common modules: removed ClientServer context, added Global module, added Privileged module. (3) Section 8.5: complete form wireframes for ordinary forms with buttons, labels, programmatic visibility, row highlighting via PriVyvodeStroki. (4) TZ v3.0: reworked estimate with per-object-type coefficients (3675h total), added section 9 with 6 platform limitations and 6 project risks, acceptance criteria updated for manual testing. (5) All references to managed forms concepts verified and replaced."
